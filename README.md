# DnD-Campaigne-Recommender
An excel sheet that recomends D&D offical campagines based on your prefenraces. 

I created this recommender because often it is hard to decide which campaign to play because you don't know enough about it to decide. So I made a list of campaigns with most of the important information to remedy this. 

The data includes information regarding:
Recomended Starting Level:    The level that the books recomend for new players to start at
End Level:                    The level that all the PCs should be by the end of the campaign
DM difficulty:                A messure of how much effort it takes to run the campaign
Player difficulty:            A messure of how difficult it is to survive the campaign
Minimum party size:           Minimum number of PCs requierd to have a balanced play
Maximum party size:           Maximum number of PCs requierd to have a balanced play
Campgaine type:               Distinguishes whether the book is a campaign (an over arching story with linear story telling), modular adventure (over arching story but modular story telling), one-shot or a (Adventure anthology) collection of one-shots.
Theme:                        Defining characteristic of the book
